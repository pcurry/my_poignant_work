I worked my way through Why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby.  I kept my progress in 
git because I use git at home all the time.  I'm a little proud of my 
version of decody.rb, because I think I improved it.  So, I tossed the whole
thing up here on github.

All of the code here except decody.rb is very close to the originals in W(p)GtR,
and should probably be considered Why's code that I typed into my system.  

decody.rb is more modified in ways that seemed clever to me when I did them.
Please check it out and feel free to weigh in on how good or idiomatic those 
modifications seem to be.
